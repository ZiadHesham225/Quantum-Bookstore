## âœ… Design Principles Used

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | Each class has a well-defined responsibility (Book, Inventory, Delivery, etc.). |
| **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** | You can add new book or delivery types without modifying existing code. |
| **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** | The `Book` class depends on an abstraction `IBookDeliveryStrategy`, not concrete services. |
